## Motivation for argument retrieval

- There is currently no widely used commercial implementation that allows for searching arguments online
- Google does not provide multiple views when queried for controversial topics
- An argument search engine retrieves pro and con arguments for a given query.

## Examples of argument search engines

- [args.me](https://www.args.me/index.html)
- [ArgumenText](https://www.argumentsearch.com/)

## Different models of information retrieval

- Boolean Retrieval Model: Based on [Boolean logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_logic) and classical [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory) in that both the documents to be searched and the user's query are  conceived as sets of terms. Retrieval is based on whether or not the  documents contain the query terms. 
- Vector Space Model
