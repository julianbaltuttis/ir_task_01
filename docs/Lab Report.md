## Classes

The following classes are probably useful for using information retrieval with Lucene. Class suggestions are based on this [tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/lucene/lucene_first_application.htm)

```java
// provides various constants to be used across the sample application.
class LuceneConstants{}
    
// Filtes and returns .json files from the database
class TextFileFilter{}

// Indexes the raw data in order to make it searchable using the Lucene library.
class Indexer{}

// Searches the indexes created by the Indexer to search the requested content.
class Searcher{}

// tests the indexing and search capability of the lucene library.
class LuceneTester{}

```
